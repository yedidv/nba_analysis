# nba_analysis

The purpose of this project was to try and predict NBA matchup outcomes given the average statistics for each team. Random Forests and Support Vector Machines
were used in this case to be able to look at the average statistics for each team, with the outcome of their regular season matchup as the dependent variable. 
These predictions can be used to determine who might win in the playoffs. Further reseearch can be done to try and look at the different statistics used 
for these predictions, and to try and determine what features are most important towards a win. Teams might be able to look at such insights so to focus on
building talent around optimizing certain statistics that might impact their likelihood to win matchups the most.
